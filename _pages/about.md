I am Gabriel J. Hurtado, a Franco-Colombian Applied Researcher, passionate about machine learning, generative models and Transformers.

I graduated in 2018 from a Master's at Georgia Tech, and from an engineer diploma at the Université de Technologie de Compiègne.

Since then, I have worked at HUAWEI Paris and I am currently an Applied Research Scientist at ElementAI. My principal focus are model based Reinforcement Learning, generative models and Vision Transformers.

I also contribute to open source projects, such as [RAMP](https://github.com/paris-saclay-cds/ramp-workflow).
