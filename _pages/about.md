I am Gabriel J. Hurtado, a Franco-Colombian research engineer, passionate about machine learning, and generative models.

I graduated in 2018 from a Masters at Georgia Tech, and from an engineer diploma at the Université de Technologie de Compiègne.

Since then, I have been working as a Research Engineer at HUAWEI Paris. My principal focus right now is Reinforcement Learning, and leveraging generative models to solve it the model based way.

I also contribute to open source projects, such as [RAMP](https://github.com/paris-saclay-cds/ramp-workflow).
