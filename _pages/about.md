I am Gabriel J. Hurtado, a Franco-Colombian Technology Scout, passionate about machine learning, generative models and Transformers.

I graduated in 2018 from a Master's at Georgia Tech, and from an engineer diploma at the Université de Technologie de Compiègne.

Since then, I have worked at HUAWEI Paris and I am currently a Technology Analyst at SONY. My job is to find cool technologies and find where they could be used within SONY.

I also contribute to open source projects, such as [RAMP](https://github.com/paris-saclay-cds/ramp-workflow).
