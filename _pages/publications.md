## Papers and projects
-	[Model Based Reinforcement Learning](https://openreview.net/forum?id=p5uylG94S68)
		*Paper accepted at ICLR 2021 and at the offline RL workshop at NeurIPS.
		We studied a Model Based Reinforcement Learning setup, in the micro data regime.
		We focused on the question: "What generative system models to choose and based on what criteria? "

 -  [Deep Learning for style
       transfer](https://gabriel-hurtado.github.io/assets/pdfs/style.pdf):
       *Applied Adaptive Instance Normalization for artificial aging of aerial views in PyTorch, Caffe and Tensorflow. This Neural Style
       Transfer project was acknowledged in a paper by A. Benbihi at the
       International Conference on Precision agriculture*

 -  [Deep Learning for Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/gabriel-hurtado/Sentiment-Analysis):
		*I led a team of four students in a project involving standard machine learning techniques along with LSTM networks,
		in Keras and Tensorflow. We focused studying customer reviews from Yelp. The model predicts scores of users’ comments with an average error of 0.4 out of 5 stars, and was able to understand comments both in English and in German.*

 -	[Transformer Model](https://deepfrench.gitlab.io/deep-learning-project/):
		*We propose an in-depth analysis and reimplementation of the Transformer model (Vaswani et al., NIPS 2017). Its non-recurrent behavior and sole use of attention makes it an intriguing model to analyze. We perform a hyper-parameters search, as well as a memory-profiling study, both of these allowing us to successfully train and semantically evaluate the model on the IWSLT TED Translation task.* 

 -	[Carbon Monoxide]( https://deepfrench.gitlab.io/data-visualisation-project/)
 		*Our goal was to create a visualization and prediction tool of Carbon Monoxide (CO) levels in the United States, and show correlation with other local phenomenon by enriching our data with various source datasets.*


## Talks and events

-	[Huawei Hackathon](https://www.bemyapp.com/events/big-data-challenge.html):
		*Created the pipeline, and problem definition of Huawei’s 2018 machine learning Hackathon.
		Monitored its smooth running with the rest of the team, checking student’s submissions and assessing their qualities and strengths. Answering questions and managing issues raised by more than 50 students from top French universities.*

- 	Tech Talk:
		*As a conclusion of my last intership, at NOKIA, I presented the results of my work centered on anomaly detection using VAE and LSTMs, leveraging those technologies to solve real world problems. Around 50 students attended in the event organized by an [association](https://assos.utc.fr/dataventure/) I helped create.*
