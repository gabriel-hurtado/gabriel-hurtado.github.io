## Talks and events

- [Huawei Hackathon](https://www.bemyapp.com/events/big-data-challenge.html):
*Created the pipeline, and problem definition of Huawei’s 2018 machine learning Hackathon.
Monitored its smooth running with the rest of the team, checking student’s submissions and assessing their qualities and strengths. Answering questions and managing issues raised by more than 50 students from top French universities.*

- Tech Talk:
*As a conclusion of my last intership, at NOKIA, I presented the results of my work centered on anomaly detection using VAE and LSTMs, leveraging those technologies to solve real world problems. Around 50 students attended in the event organized by an [association](https://assos.utc.fr/dataventure/) I helped create.*
